[02:46.040] We interpreted all the romance
[02:49.480] To each other
[02:52.080] What making my memories all hazy
[02:56.040] So many flaws were there
[02:58.320] But I can't shake those memories
[03:01.280] That most wonderful rainy season
[03:04.840] And you the real no frills at all
[03:10.120] Maybe it's the summer rain
