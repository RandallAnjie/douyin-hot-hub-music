[01:20.680] And never says go read a book
[01:23.520] Guess I gotta build my dream from scratch
[01:27.040] Draw his smile then give it a patch
[01:29.880] Plug him in and hope he runs
[01:32.800] Call it love or just for fun
[01:35.360] No eyes no sparks just vibes that click
[01:38.280] If he's a mess I'll hit unpick
[01:41.560] Franken boy with better taste
[01:44.000] No monster just a pretty face
[01:46.720] Maybe he's out there or maybe not so
